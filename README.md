## Introduction
RP2040 microcontroller and APDS9960 sensor board are used in this lab. There are two main results are presented:    
* The APDS9960 sensor was set up to make the LED on the RP2040 blink in response to the fireflies in the video, and the result is shown by Figure 1.  
* By understanding the CircuitPython HID Keyboard Library, a custom program was created and the result is shown by Figure 2.
